## Agile Ways of Working

Most teams developing modern digital services for the B.C. government are approaching their work with an [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) mindset. While many teams have adopted  [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) as an agile framework, there is no single official or mandated agile methodology or framework within the B.C. government. Teams and leaders within different areas may choose the approaches they feel most suited to their work.
