# Common Components

Common Components are Open Source tools developed by the BC Government that are owned and maintained by product teams as part of their mandate. 

As part of the [Digital Investment Office priorities](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/topics/funding/intro/), teams are required to use these for projects receiving IM/IT capital funding from the OCIO.
