### API Management Platform

The BC Government [API Management Platform](docs/default/component/aps-infra-platform-docs) is a common component that serves as a central entry point for APIs, and acts as an intermediary between applications and backend services. 

### API Registry

### BC Data Catalogue

[The BC Data Catalogue](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/bc-data-catalogue) provides the easiest access to government's data holdings, as well as their associated applications and web services. Thousands of the datasets discoverable in the Catalogue are available under the [Open Government License - British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/open-data/open-government-licence-bc).

### Geospatial Data

The province's area, varied topography and predominantly natural resource based economy has positioned B.C. as a leader in geographic information management and generates a wealth of geographic information that is discoverable in the BC Data Catalogue.  BC Data Service provides access to this information through a suite of unique applications and services that comprise [the B.C. Spatial Data Infrastructure](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/geographic-data-services).

## Support

If you're working on a project that will hold citizen or buisness data, or needs to connect to an existing resource, the [Data Services Client Hub](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1) can help connect you to the right place for support.
