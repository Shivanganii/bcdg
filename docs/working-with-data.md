# Working with Data

The BC Data Service (formerly known as Data BC) encourages and enables the strategic management and sharing of data across the government enterprise and with the public. 

Access to trusted, high quality data is essential for the success of British Columbia - expressed in effective government decision making, a robust economy, and improved well-being for all of its citizens. 

## API Resources

### API Directory

The [API Directory](https://api.gov.bc.ca/devportal/api-directory) provides a place to share your API for developers to discover.

### API Management Platform

The BC Government [API Management Platform](docs/default/component/aps-infra-platform-docs) is a common component that serves as a central entry point for APIs, and acts as an intermediary between applications and backend services. 

### API Registry

APIs within the [BC Data Catalogue](#bc-data-catalogue) can be found in the [API Registry](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/group/bc-government-api-registry)

### API Services Portal

If you are a developer or part of a government team, you can administer and manage your APIs using the [API Services Portal](https://api.gov.bc.ca/).

## Other Resources

### BC Data Catalogue

[The BC Data Catalogue](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/bc-data-catalogue) provides the easiest access to government's data holdings, as well as applications and web services. Thousands of the datasets discoverable in the Catalogue are available under the Open Government License - British Columbia.

### Geospatial Data

The province's area, varied topography and predominantly natural resource based economy has positioned B.C. as a leader in geographic information management and generates a wealth of geographic information that is discoverable in the BC Data Catalogue.  DataBC provides access to this information through a suite of unique applications and services that comprise [the B.C. Spatial Data Infrastructure](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/geographic-data-services).
