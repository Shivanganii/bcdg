# BC's Digital Government Vision & Plan

## Digital Government 101

As the practices of developing and delivering digital services within the B.C. government have evolved, so has corporate guidance. Three important examples are highlighted below.  

1. [The Digital Plan](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/policies-standards/digital-plan/) describes the four missions and calls to action for Ministries in supporting the digital services they provide to citizens.
2. [The Digital Code of Practice](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/policies-standards/dcop/) expands on what good implementation of digital products and services looks like.
3. [Digital Government website](https://digital.gov.bc.ca) hosts the materials above as well as content about many other topics for digital practitioners and leaders within the B.C. government.
