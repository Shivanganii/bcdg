# BC's Digital Government Vision & Plan

## Digital Government 101

As the modernization of delivering digital services to citizens has matured, so have the policies and governance around how we apply that within the organization. 

1. [The Digital Plan](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/policies-standards/digital-plan/) desribes the four missions and calls to action for Ministries in supporting the digital services they provide to citizens.

2. [The Digital Code of Practice](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/policies-standards/dcop/) expands on what good implementation of digital products and services looks like.


## Agile Ways of Working

It up to teams and leadership within different areas to choose what flavour of Agile works best, there is no one methodology or framework within the BC Government.
