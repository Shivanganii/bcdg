# Selecting Technology for a B.C. Government System

Selecting suitable technology is an important step in developing a system for the B.C. government and the teams and individuals involved in building new systems have the latitude to make choices about the technologies their systems will use. There is a wide range of technology currently in use within the systems built for and by the B.C government.  The section below contains a cross-section of some of the technology options used within the B.C. government's growing portfolio of modern digital services, with links to relevant resources.

## Determining suitability

While there is a range of possible choices shown above, neither the categories nor the examples in the table above are exhaustive and inclusion in the list doesn't represent an endorsement or recommendation. Each team is responsible for doing its own analysis to determine the suitability of a technology for its needs and situation.  The list below includes some important considerations that may be relevant to a team's technology choices.
