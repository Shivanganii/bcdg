# Selecting Technology for a B.C. Government System

Selecting suitable technology is an important step in developing a system for the B.C. government and the teams and individuals involved in building new systems have the latitude to make choices about the technologies their systems will use. There is a wide range of technology currently in use within the systems built for and by the B.C government.  The section below contains a cross-section of some of the technology options used within the B.C. government's growing portfolio of modern digital services, with links to relevant resources.
