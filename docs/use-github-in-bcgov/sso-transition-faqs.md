## IDIR FAQs

### I am a contractor who doesn't already have an IDIR account today. What kind do I need?

Please reach out to your My Service Center representative in your area of government to ask them to assist you in creating this account. Your request is for an IDIR account with O365 access because this is the only kind that allows users to authenticate with SSO.

Your Director should be able to connect you to the right part of the organization to fulfill this request, as well as help find someone to approve the request if they are not already the expense authority. 

### I am a contractor who has an IDIR account, but it doesn't have an O365 license attached

Please reach out to your My Service Center representative in your area of government to ask them to assist you in upgrading your existing IDIR account. Your request is for an IDIR account with O365 access because this is the only kind that allows users to authenticate with SSO.

Your Director should be able to connect you to the right part of the organization to fulfill this request, as well as help find someone to approve the request if they are not already the expense authority. 


### What is the cost and lead time for an IDIR O365 license

Please see [Service Bulletin 1350](https://ociomysc.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&sys_id=7a69f65fdbff9d10fa86193813961978&spa=1) for more information. 

We are excited to share that there is a future change coming to overall access within the government that will enable other types of SSO authentication for contractors in future that will not require an IDIR 0365 license. We appreciate your patience while we work to scale this new initiative so it is ready to roll out to you in future. 

## GitHub FAQs

### How do I regain access to the bcgov GitHub org if I was locked out after September 13th
- If you are a contractor who does not yet have an IDIR with O365 access, follow the steps in the [IDIR FAQs](sso-transition-faqs.md#idir-faqs) before proceeding.
- If you have a valid IDIR, have anyone who has access to the organization re-invite you via [JustAsk]()
     - You will need to [reset your keys](sso-transition-faqs.md#how-do-i-reset-my-github-keys).
     - Once you have regained access, you will need to be re-invited by your teammates with admin access to the repositories you previously had access to.

### Do I need to make a new GitHub ID tied to my government email before making this change?

No, in line with the GitHub terms of service, we encourage you to continue to use your personal GitHub ID and retain all of your GitHub history and credibility. Linking your IDIR is sufficient. 

### How do I reset my GitHub Keys

If you use VS Code, it should prompt you automatically. If not, follow the instructions from GitHub.
